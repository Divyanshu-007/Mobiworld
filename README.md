# MOBIWORLD

The project "MOBIWORLD" is a website designed for buying and selling mobile phones. It provides users with a platform to view and purchase the latest mobile phones available in the market. The website is built using technologies such as React.js, JavaScript, Material-UI, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.

With MOBIWORLD, users can explore a wide range of mobile phones, view their specifications, compare prices, and make purchases securely. The website offers a user-friendly interface, ensuring a seamless and intuitive browsing experience.
